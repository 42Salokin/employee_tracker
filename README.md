  This application is a content management system. It utilizes Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL to manage a company's employee database. Opening the application in the command line, the user will be prompted a series of options to view, add, or delete departments, roles, or employees, as well as update an employee's role. Changes will be made to the database, then the results can be displayed in formatted tables in the command line.
